## Features
- Experimentation with ESP32 microcontroller and diode circuits.
- Includes sample code for diode control and ESP32 setup.
- Suitable for beginners learning Arduino and ESP32 programming.
- Demonstrates basic input/output operations with a potentiometer.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Arduino ESP32 Diode Experiment on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Arduino IDE**: Download and install from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- **ESP32 Board Support**: Add ESP32 support to the Arduino IDE (instructions below).
- **Hardware**: ESP32 development board, diodes, potentiometer, and basic breadboard setup.
- **USB Cable**: To connect the ESP32 to your computer.

### Steps
1. **Install Arduino IDE**:
   - Download and install the latest Arduino IDE if not already installed.
2. **Add ESP32 Board Support**:
   - Open Arduino IDE, go to `File > Preferences`.
   - In "Additional Boards Manager URLs," add: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`.
   - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`, search for "ESP32," and install the package by Espressif.
3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyadazi/Range-mynewprojects.git
   ```
4. **Open the Project**:
   - Navigate to the `Arduino esp32 Diode Experiment` folder.
   - Open `sketch_Diode.ino` or `ESP32_Microcontroller.ino` in Arduino IDE.
5. **Select Board and Port**:
   - In Arduino IDE, go to `Tools > Board` and select your ESP32 board (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module").
   - Connect your ESP32 via USB and select the correct port under `Tools > Port`.
6. **Upload the Code**:
   - Click the upload button (right arrow) to load the code onto the ESP32.

## Usage

### Basic Example
- Open `sketch_Diode.ino` in Arduino IDE.
- Upload the code to your ESP32.
- Connect a diode and potentiometer as per the circuit described in the code comments (e.g., diode anode to GPIO pin, cathode to ground).
- Adjust the potentiometer to see the diode behavior (e.g., brightness control if using PWM).

### Expected Output
- The diode should light up based on the potentiometer input, demonstrating analog input and digital output control.

### Notes
- Check the code comments in `Diode code.txt` for specific pin assignments and circuit details.
- Modify the code as needed for different diode or potentiometer configurations.
